# Protein Recognition Index (PRI)

![](docs/sources/images/pri-logo.png)

The Protein Recognition Index (PRI) measures the similarity between H-bonding features in a given complex (predicted or designed) and the characteristic H-bond trends from crystallographic complexes based on hydrogen-bond interactions idendified by [Hbind](https://github.com/psa-lab/Hbind) (software for rigorously defining intermolecular H-bonds by donor/acceptor chemistry and geometric constraints).

The PRI was developed, used, and described in detail in

## Installation

No installation is required to execute the Protein Recognition Index software, which is available from the `code` subdirectory in this repository: [`./code/pri-score.py`](./code/pri-score.py). However, a current version of Python is required; we recommend [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) or greater.

In addition, running `pri-score.py` requires hydrogen-bond interaction tables as generated by [Hbind](http://psa-lab.github.io/Hbind). Hbind is freely available, and for more information on how to install and use it, please visit [http://psa-lab.github.io/Hbind](http://psa-lab.github.io/Hbind).

## Usage

The Protein Recognition Score software can be executed from the command line and takes an [Hbind](http://psa-lab.github.io/Hbind) interaction table as input, which lists the hydrogen-bond interactions between a protein and its ligand.

The following example illustrates how to compute the PRI score for the 1KPF [1KPF](https://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1kpf) complex (PKCI-substrate analog) with its ligand `1KPF_AMP.mol2` (adenosine monophsophate). The structures are provided in the "[example_files/](./example_files)" subdirectory along with the generated Hbind interaction table.

To compute the PRI score, simply invoke the following command in your terminal:

    python code/pri-score.py example_files/hbind_output.txt

The resulting output is shown below:

The Protein PRI (PRI-prot) and Ligand PRI (PRI-lig) scores are computed based on the hydrogen bond statistics across 136 non-homologous protein-ligand complexes as described in

- Sebastian Raschka, Wolf A., Bemister-Buffington J., and Kuhn L.A. (2018) 
"Protein-ligand interfaces are polarized: Discovery of a strong trend for intermolecular hydrogen bonds to favor donors on the protein side with implications for predicting and designing ligand complexes." J. Computer-Aided Molec. Design [in revision]

The PRI is then computed by standardizing the Protein and Ligand PRI scores and adding these, respectively:

Here, &mu; (mean) and &sigma; (standard deviation) were derived from the 136 PRI-lig and PRI-prot scores computed from the 136 non-homologous complexes. Hence, the range of the PRI score is [-2, 2], where higher scores are better.
